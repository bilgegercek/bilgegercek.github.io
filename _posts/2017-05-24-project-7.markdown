description: Bodrum is one of the major resort towns in Turkey with a population of 145K during winter and the town hosts 
between 1M and 1.5M vacationers during summer. Bodrum Chamber of Commerce (BODTO) had  published an app named  "Let's Bodrum" a year before my team was included in the project. It was a promotion app to promote members of BODTO and to assist its users with informing about businesses and events in Bodrum. BODTO asked us to re-design the app because the existing app wasnâ€™t meeting the expectations of the client.
