description: Bodrum is one of the major resort towns in Turkey with a population of 145K during winter and the town hosts between 1M and 1.5M vacationers during summer. Bodrum Chamber of Commerce (BODTO) had  published an app named  "Let's Bodrum" a year before my team was included in the project. It was a promotion app to promote members of BODTO and to assist its users with informing about businesses and events in Bodrum. BODTO asked us to re-design the app because the existing app wasnâ€™t meeting the expectations of the client. 
role: I worked as a UX/UI designer while collaborating directly with the development team. I led the design work by analyzing the existing application, redefining the structure of information, creating user scenarios, producing the wireframes, user flows and interface design. 
process: After a successful project pitch, we were asked to submit a working prototype in one month. We studied tourism statistics and reports published by regional municipality and Ministry of Tourism and Culture, then analyzed the previous design of Let's Bodrum as well as other available navigation and promotion apps on Play Store. 
details1: Previously published version of the application had multiple strands. One of the major problems of the apps interface was the unclear navigation pattern. Information provided was not grouped properly and the buttons were floating around the home screen. This hindered the clarity of the information structure. Another problem was unpredictable interaction design. Button-like visual elements with no function discouraged users due to the misleading design. We were to re-organize the content and to re-design the interaction and user interface accordingly. Our main objective was to communicate simply and clearly with the users. 
details2: The target users of the app was professionals aged between 25-40 years old who either reside in Bodrum or visit for a period of time. Personas and user scenarios are created according to these, and we generated the project requirements based on the user scenarios.

user-scenario: Sofia stays at a hotel in downtown for a week. This is her first night in town and she is a bit tired after 4-hour flight. She cannot decide whether to have a relaxed night with a glass of wine after dinner or to explore around to find shops that sell authentic souvenirs. While at the lobby she pulls out her phone before heading to hotel's restaurant, opens Let's Bodrum app and checks nearby bars. She cannot find any bar within 500m. and extends the radius of her search. The nearest bar is about 1.5 km. away from her hotel. She doesn't feel like walking there and considers having a short walk to check nearby stores close to her hotel. Then she remembers the store that her friend mentioned which carries one-of-a-kind lamps. She searches for the store, realizes that it is 300m.-walk away from her hotel. While checking the store details, she sees that there is a 50% deal on lamps that she can benefit via the app. She prints the QR code to get the deal and heads to the restaurant to have her dinner. 
details3: I designed and sketched the wireframes and user flows. Once we evaluated the design alternatives I created, the rest of the team started to work on developing the app. I designed the hi-fi UI mock ups.
