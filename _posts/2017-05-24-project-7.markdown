description: Bodrum is one of the major resort towns in Turkey with a population of 145K during winter and the town hosts between 1M and 1.5M vacationers during summer. Bodrum Chamber of Commerce (BODTO) had  published an app named  "Let's Bodrum" a year before my team was included in the project. It was a promotion app to promote members of BODTO and to assist its users with informing about businesses and events in Bodrum. BODTO asked us to re-design the app because the existing app wasnâ€™t meeting the expectations of the client. 
role: I worked as a UX/UI designer while collaborating directly with the development team. I led the design work by analyzing the existing application, redefining the structure of information, creating user scenarios, producing the wireframes, user flows and interface design. 
process: After a successful project pitch, we were asked to submit a working prototype in one month. We studied tourism statistics and reports published by regional municipality and Ministry of Tourism and Culture, then analyzed the previous design of Let's Bodrum as well as other available navigation and promotion apps on Play Store. After identifying personas and use case scenarios to help us generate project requirements, I sketched the wireframes and user flows. Once we evaluated the design alternatives I created, the rest of the team started to work on developing the app. I designed the hi-fi UI mock ups.
